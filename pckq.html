                Context: Students have learned about free body diagrams and Newton’s 2nd law.
                A group of students is working on a question about a block sliding down a frictionless inclined plane. 
                They are required to draw a force diagram to explain why the block slides down. 
                You approach that group, notice their force diagram as shown below, and have a conversation with one of them
              </h4>
              <!--                    </li>-->

                She wants to check whether the students understand the
                relationship between s-t, v-t, and a-t graphs. Below is the
                conversation she has with them<br />
                You: So why does the block slide down?<br />
                Student: It slides down because we have a x component of the normal force acting on it, so that’s why it slides down.<br />
                You: What do you mean by x component of the normal force?<br />
                Student: Force is a vector, so when there is a force, there should be x and y components.<br />
                You: So what is the x component of the normal force?<br />
                Student: With respect to the table surface, y is perpendicular, and x is parallel.<br />
                You: OK, then which component or which force determines if this block moves or not?<br />
                Student: The x component of the normal force. The y component cancels out with gravity.<br />
                a) What conclusion can you draw about the student’s knowledge
                based on the information provided above?<br />
                b) What may be the student’s difficulties? What support or help
                do you think the student needs from the SA?<br />
                c) How should the SA respond to the student? Why?<br /></h4>
              <h3 style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sample LAs’ answers</b></h3>
              <h4 class="about-school-detail" style="text-align: justify;">
                LA-1<br />
                a. Is this student answer correct? Why?<br />
                The student is not exactly wrong since they are able to identify what 
                axis the force causing the object to move occurs on as being the x axis.
                The issue is that the student is relating it to force normal instead 
                of the force of gravity which actually has components.<br />
                <br />
                b. What can you conclude from the information provided about the student’s 
                physics content knowledge, both the strengths (i.e. what he/she knows) 
                and difficulties (i.e. what he/she does not know)?<br />
                From this I understand that the student is aware of how to break 
                their forces into components based on an axis they define. The possible problem 
                that the student might be facing is that they are using an axis whose y axis 
                is perpendicular to the earth (the default axis) instead of one that is oriented
                along the ramp. Another thing that I would need to address is the importance of
                understanding that force is a vector and the direction it points is important 
                to the direction that the object moved.<br />
                <br/>
                c. How would you respond to the student? Please use direct quote 
                of what you would say. What is(are) your purpose(s) behind that response?<br />
                “Can you draw the axis that you are using the solve the situation?” – to identify
                how they’re forces are aligned “Is it easier to draw an axis with the x-axis parallel
                to the earth or parallel to the surface we are travelling on?” – to highlight importance
                of choosing an axis that makes it easy to understand the situation “Can you draw and
                label the component of the normal force that causes the object to slide down” – to start
                a discussion on how the direction of the component they are about to draw either is in reference to
                the force of gravity or that it does not point in a direction parallel to the surface
                we are travelling on. This would allow for us to talk about distinctions between 1D and 2D situations.
